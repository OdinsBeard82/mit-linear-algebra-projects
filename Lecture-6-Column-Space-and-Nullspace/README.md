# Lecture 6: Column Space and Nullspace

This folder includes code and notes for **Lecture 6 of MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra**.

## Summary
- Understanding the column space C(A)
- Understanding the nullspace N(A)
- Relationship between pivots, rank, and free variables
- Rank–Nullity Theorem
- Computing bases for C(A) and N(A)

## Python Implementation
- `column_nullspace.py`  
  Uses NumPy and SymPy to compute:
  - column space basis
  - nullspace basis
  - rank and nullity

## Notes
See `lecture6_notes.md` for full explanations and derivations.
