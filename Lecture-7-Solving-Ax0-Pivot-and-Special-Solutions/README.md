# Lecture 7: Solving Ax = 0 — Pivot Variables & Special Solutions

This folder includes code and notes for **Lecture 7 of MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra**.

## Summary
- Solving the homogeneous system Ax = 0
- Identifying pivot and free variables
- Constructing special solutions
- Basis for the nullspace
- Understanding nullity and its relationship to rank

## Python Implementation
- `solve_ax0.py`  
  Uses SymPy to:
  - compute the row-reduced form (RREF)
  - identify pivot columns
  - compute nullspace basis vectors
  - display rank and nullity

## Notes
See `lecture7_notes.md` for explanations and step-by-step derivations.
