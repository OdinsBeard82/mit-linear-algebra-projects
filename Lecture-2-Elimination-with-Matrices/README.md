# Lecture 2: Elimination with Matrices

This folder contains Python implementations and notes from **Lecture 2 of MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra**.

## Summary
- Gaussian elimination for solving linear systems
- Row operations and pivoting
- Forward elimination and back substitution

## Python Implementation
- `gaussian_elimination.py` – Solves Ax = b using Gaussian elimination in Python

## Example Output
System:
2x + y - z = 8
-3x - y + 2z = -11
-2x + y + 2z = -3

Solution:
x = 2, y = 3, z = -1


## Notes
See `lecture2_notes.md` for a summary of key concepts and step-by-step examples.

## Learning Path / Portfolio Context
This project is part of my **Phase 1 AI / Machine Learning study path**, applying linear algebra concepts in Python to prepare for future ML projects.
