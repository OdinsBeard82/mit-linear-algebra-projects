# Lecture 2: Elimination with Matrices

## Key Concepts
- Gaussian elimination is used to systematically reduce a linear system to row echelon form
- Pivot elements are used to eliminate variables step by step
- Forward elimination followed by back substitution solves the system
- This method generalizes to any number of variables in a linear system

## Python Implementation
- Implemented Gaussian elimination from scratch in Python
- Verified results with a known solution vector
- Demonstrates row operations and systematic elimination in code
