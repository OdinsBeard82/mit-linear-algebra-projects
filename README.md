# mit-linear-algebra-projects

Python implementations of MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra lectures — building foundational math skills for AI / Machine Learning.

---

## Overview

This repository contains Python projects, notes, and mini-implementations corresponding to MIT OCW 18.06 Linear Algebra lectures. Each lecture folder includes:

* **Lecture notes** summarizing key concepts
* **Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks** implementing lecture topics
* **Optional visualizations or example outputs**

The goal is to reinforce the math concepts while gaining hands-on Python experience applicable to Machine Learning and AI. All projects are part of a structured **12-month AI / ML study path**.

## Learning Path / AI / ML Roadmap

This repository is **Phase 1** of a structured AI / Machine Learning study path:

1. **Phase 1:** Python + Linear Algebra (this repo)
2. **Phase 2:** Probability & Statistics
3. **Phase 3:** Core ML algorithms (scikit-learn)
4. **Phase 4:** Deep Learning (TensorFlow / PyTorch)
5. **Phase 5:** Deployment & Portfolio Projects

Each lecture adds practical Python implementations and portfolio-ready code.
