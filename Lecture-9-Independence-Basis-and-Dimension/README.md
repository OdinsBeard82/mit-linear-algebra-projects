# Lecture 9: Independence, Basis, and Dimension

This folder contains Python code and notes for **Lecture 9 of MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra**.

## Summary
- Linear independence and dependence
- Bases of vector spaces
- Dimension and rank
- Relationship between pivots, basis vectors, and dimension
- Connections between column space and nullspace

## Python Implementation
- `basis_and_dimension.py`
  - computes matrix rank
  - extracts bases for column space and nullspace
  - prints dimensions of each space

## Notes
See `lecture9_notes.md` for conceptual explanations.
