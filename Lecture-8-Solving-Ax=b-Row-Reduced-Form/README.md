# Lecture 8: Solving Ax = b — Row Reduced Form

This folder contains Python code and notes for **Lecture 8 of MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra**.

## Summary
- Solving non-homogeneous systems Ax = b
- Using the augmented matrix [A | b]
- Row Reduced Echelon Form (RREF)
- Particular solutions and nullspace solutions
- Connection between column space and solvability

## Python Implementation
- `solve_axb.py`
  - builds the augmented matrix
  - computes RREF
  - identifies pivot variables
  - outputs the nullspace basis

## Notes
See `lecture8_notes.md` for explanations and theory.
