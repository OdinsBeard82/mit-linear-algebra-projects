# Lecture 1: The Geometry of Linear Equations

## Key Concepts
- Linear systems: Ax = b
- Geometric interpretation: solution sets are intersections of lines (2D) or planes (3D)
- Systems may have:
  - A unique solution
  - No solution
  - Infinitely many solutions
- Understanding solution space helps with visualizing linear algebra concepts

## Python Implementation
- Used NumPy's `linalg.solve` to compute the solution vector
- Provides practical understanding of how linear systems are solved numerically
