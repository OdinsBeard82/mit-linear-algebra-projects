# Lecture 1: The Geometry of Linear Equations

This folder contains Python implementations and notes from **Lecture 1 of MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra**.

## Summary
- Explores the geometry of linear equations
- Understanding solution spaces
- Visualizing systems of equations

## Python Implementation
- `linear_systems.py` – Solves linear systems using Python and NumPy

## Example Output
System:
2x + y = 8
-3x - y + 2z = -11
-2x + y + 2z = -3

Solution:
x = 2, y = 3, z = -1


## Notes
See `lecture1_notes.md` for a summary of key concepts and formulas.

## Learning Path / Portfolio Context
This project is part of my **Phase 1 AI / Machine Learning study path**, applying linear algebra concepts in Python to prepare for future ML projects.
